Hypothesis Testing: Price Sensitivity

Hypothesis: Customers are sensitive to price changes; higher prices lead to higher churn.

Analysis Steps:

Created aggregated price features:

Average prices over the full year, last 6 months, and last 3 months.

Calculated combined variable + fixed prices for off-peak, peak, and mid-peak periods.

Merged aggregated price features with churn data.

Examined correlations between price variables and churn.

Findings:

Correlation between churn and price variables is very low.

Indicates that customersâ€™ churn is not strongly sensitive to price changes.

Other factors (e.g., consumption patterns, contract terms, or service features) likely play a bigger role in churn.
