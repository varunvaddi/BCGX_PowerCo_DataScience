# PowerCo Client Data Analysis & Price Sensitivity Study

## Overview
This project analyzes client consumption and pricing data provided by PowerCo to understand customer behavior, particularly **churn patterns** and **price sensitivity**. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing.

## Data
Two datasets were provided:

### 1. `client_data.csv`
Contains client-level information, including consumption, margins, and churn status.

**Key columns:**
- `id` : Client company identifier
- `churn` : Target variable, indicates if the client churned
- `cons_12m`, `cons_last_month` : Consumption metrics
- `forecast_*` : Forecasted consumption and price metrics
- `margin_*`, `net_margin` : Margin-related metrics
- `channel_sales`, `has_gas`, `origin_up` : Categorical features
- `date_activ`, `date_end`, `date_modif_prod`, `date_renewal` : Contract dates
- `pow_max`, `nb_prod_act`, `num_years_antig` : Client profile metrics

### 2. `price_data.csv`
Contains time-series pricing information for each client.

**Key columns:**
- `id` : Client company identifier
- `price_date` : Date of price record
- `price_off_peak_var`, `price_peak_var`, `price_mid_peak_var` : Variable energy prices
- `price_off_peak_fix`, `price_peak_fix`, `price_mid_peak_fix` : Fixed power prices

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked **data types**, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
- Visualized **numerical features** with histograms and KDE plots.
- Visualized **categorical features** with bar plots.
- Calculated **correlations** among numerical features using heatmaps.
- Conducted **pairplots** for numeric features to inspect relationships.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted date columns to `datetime` type.
- Handled missing values.
- Created **percentage change and rolling average price features** for 3-month and 6-month windows.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created aggregated features from `price_data.csv`:
  - Yearly, 6-month, and 3-month average prices
  - Combined variable + fixed prices for each period
  - Percentage changes over 3-month and 6-month periods
- Merged these features with `client_data.csv` for modeling.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing: Price Sensitivity
- **Hypothesis**: Customers are sensitive to price changes.  
- Observed price trends over 3-month, 6-month, and yearly windows for churned vs retained clients.
- Calculated correlations between churn and price features.
- **Conclusion**: Correlation between churn and price variables is very low → Customers’ churn is **not strongly sensitive to price changes**.
